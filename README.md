Using Text to Speech API and Joke Teller API and combining them together.

<h3>https://shawshanck.github.io/joke-teller/</h3>

* Get jokes text from an API.
* Convert text to speech and make an audio from VoiceRSS API.
* Play jokes audio.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* HTML: Basic HTML to stablish a standalone page. Creating button and audio element.
* CSS: Responsive coding, styling button and using Pseudo Classes like mouse "hover".
* JavaScript: Calling HTML elements, using 2 different APIs, one for jokes text and another for converting text to audio. Creating function to toggle button disabled/enabled. Button also uses additional "eventlistener" to stay disabled while jokes audio is being played.

> **Note**: You should get your own API Key from https://voicerss.org/ and replace it in line 19 of script.js.
